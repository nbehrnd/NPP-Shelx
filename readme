# NPP-Shelx

This XML file aims to extend the languages recognized by the editor Notepad++ [1] by the keywords of ShelXL of the Shelx [2] suite. It is based on the alphabetical list of instructions that alreaday was compiled by Lee Daniels [3] as accessed on January 11th, 2017.  Intentionally, both uppercase as well as lowercase typing of the commands is allowed.  In addition the old SHELXL-97 commands TIME, HOPE and MOLE -- despite being deprecated by now -- are included.

Note that syntax highligting of ShelX commands equally is provided by LaTeX usepackage listings [4]
